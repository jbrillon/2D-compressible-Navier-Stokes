# 2D Compressible Navier-Stokes Solver

Solves the 2D compressible Navier-Stokes equations using finite-difference with a staggered grid arrangement to simulate acoustic waves in a doubly periodic domain.

## Pressure Waves

## Staggered Grid Arrangement

The grid arrangement for passive scalars, x-velocity, and y-velocity are shown below, respectfully.
